## Project Title: Art gallery site 
---

### Project Objective 
Your challenge is to build out this art gallery website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

### Customer Requirements 
* Your users should be able to: 
> 1. View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size 
> 2. See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site 
> 3. Optional: create an interactive location map with a custom location pin  

### Deliverables 
 * Web application source code (GitHub - implement Git flow with a reasonable number of commits including a well-written README file) 
 * CSS - Use styled-components 
 * Deployed link  
 
### Evaluation Criteria 
 * To which degree does the application really fulfil the customer needs?
 *  How did the candidate utilize git-flow processes (feature branches etc. pull requests)? 
 *  How well did the design appeal to the user, colour combination, consistency, usability? 
 *  How well did the candidate present his/her results?
